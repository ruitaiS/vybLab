class MetaNet:
    #Basically same kinda stuff as was in v1.py in the old version

    #subnet, metanet, alternet

    #takes subnet and alternet as initialization parameters?

    #init with default learning rate? and then have functions that can manually set the learning rates of the networks

    #run & test as endpoints for Sean
        #May need some adjusting of the data for this one, since meta has slightly different label format
