Goal for Tonight:
    Get metaNN working with Tester

Tomorrow:
    Refactor / update tester.py

tester.py:
    merge redundant data parsing w/ data.py
    Add testing only sets (no training)
    Refactor so it's not just one big "test_model" function
        seperate data parsing (probably goes into data.py), training, testing, display into their own functions

    tester phase 1 only trains on numbers, so meta never produces a 1
    phase 2 retrains, with half of the data it's already seen before
